# Cœur défiant
This is a project for getting trans folk easy access to all of the information they need in a single page.

You can currently view the project on my [GitHub page](https://avizc.github.io/projects/coeurdefiant/).
## Goals
These are things I intend to implement:
* A basic form inputting user specifics (e.g. location, gender) to get all information needed on a single page
* Access to healthcare needs (e.g. hormones, surgery) rules and requirements per state
* ID card rules and requirements regarding name change and/or gender marker change per state
* Birth certificate rules and requirements regarding and/or gender marker change per state
* Local LGBTQ and transgender friendly organisations
* An expanded help edition in case an individual is receiving pushback/denied
* Who to contact if not being adequetely assisted with
Other things to do:
* Get a new domain name for it once I can afford to do so
## Goals Completed
These are things I have implemented:
* Basic website made
