This is a project for getting trans folk easy access to all of the information they need in a single page.

* Access to healthcare needs (e.g. hormones, surgery) rules and requirements per state
* ID card rules and requirements regarding name change and/or gender marker change per state
* Birth certificate rules and requirements regarding and/or gender marker change per state
* Local LGBTQ and transgender friendly organisations
* An expanded help edition in case an individual is receiving pushback/denied
* Who to contact if not being adequetely assisted with
